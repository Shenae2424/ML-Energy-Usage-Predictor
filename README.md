# EcoPredict: Household Energy Usage Forecasting with ML
Predicts household electricity usage based on historical data using Python and Machine Learning 

## My motivation
When I first decided to start this project, I wanted to start applying Python to things that would further my knowledge and confidence in the language. I also wanted to showcase my ability to pick up and learn different technical skills when outside of my comfort zone. Before completing this project, I had no knowledge of machine learning, some basic knowledge of python and  the curiosity to learn a new skill. 

## Materials Used: 
- Programming with Mosh - Python Full Course for Beginners https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMTl6ZDUMqM
- Kite - How to use Matplotlib in 4 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4VlmL3G4_o
- Data Set - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

## üéØAim
- Be able to apply basic Python for data analysis 
- Understand energy usage trends
- Understand time series data in the context of energy consumption.
- Develop data cleaning and preprocessing skills (handling missing values, parsing dates).
- Explore and visualize energy usage trends over time.
- Engineer features that capture temporal patterns (hour, day, month).
- Build and evaluate a simple predictive model for energy consumption.
- Interpret model results and understand their limitations.

## Uses
- Energy Providers can use predictive models to forecast electricity demand, allowing better power grid management and reducing outages.
- Smart Home Systems can optimize appliance usage to save energy and reduce costs based on predicted power consumption patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏èTools and Libraries 
- Jupyter 
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn

## To do: 

### Import Data 
- find and save the data set
- load data set using pandas 
- display first 5 roiws 
- check for any missing values 
- learn and understand the meaning of columns 


### Clean Data of Duplicates etc. 
- Handle missing or invalid values (dreop or fill them in)
- convert date and time columns into simple datetime format
- select feaqtures to use for prediction (time, voltgae, previopus power used)
 

### Split data into training/training sets

### creater a model 
- plot graphs using matplotlib to understand trends (power/time, voltage/time)
- use Scitkit-learn to create a linear regression model
- predict power usage on test data 
- evaluate the models performance 

### train the model 
### make predictions
