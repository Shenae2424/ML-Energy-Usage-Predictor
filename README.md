# EcoPredict: Household Energy Usage Forecasting with ML
Forcast regional electricity demand based on historical data using Python and Machine Learning 

## My motivation
When I first decided to start this project, I wanted to start applying Python to things that would further my knowledge and confidence in the language. I also wanted to showcase my ability to pick up and learn different technical skills when outside of my comfort zone. Before completing this project, I had no knowledge of machine learning, some basic knowledge of python and  the curiosity to learn a new skill. 

## Materials Used: 
- Programming with Mosh - Python Full Course for Beginners https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMTl6ZDUMqM
- Data Set - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

## üéØAim
- Be able to apply basic Python for data analysis 
- To produce charts that show distribution and trends
- perform energy usage analysis
- Split the last year into a test set- can you build a model to predict energy consumption?
- Find trends in energy consumption around hours of the day, holidays, or long term trends?
- Understand how daily trends change depending of the time of year. Summer trends are very different than winter trends.

## Example Uses
Load forecasting involves predicting future electricity demand using historical consumption data. Accurate forecasts are essential for maintaining grid stability and ensuring that generation matches demand.

#### Real-World Impact:
- Grid reliability: Prevents blackouts by ensuring enough electricity is generated during peak periods.
- Cost savings: Allows operators to schedule generation more efficiently and avoid costly reserve usage.
- Renewable integration: Helps balance intermittent sources like solar and wind with predicted demand.
