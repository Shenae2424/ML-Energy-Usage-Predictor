# EcoPredict: Household Energy Usage Forecasting with ML
Forcast regional electricity demand based on historical data using Python and Machine Learning 

## My motivation
When I first decided to start this project, I wanted to start applying Python to things that would further my knowledge and confidence in the language. I also wanted to showcase my ability to pick up and learn different technical skills when outside of my comfort zone. Before completing this project, I had no knowledge of machine learning, some basic knowledge of python and  the curiosity to learn a new skill. 

## Materials Used:

## üéØAim
- Be able to apply basic Python for data analysis 
- Forecast future hourly wage consumption in the next 24 hours using time series ML methods
- 

## Example Uses

Load forecasting involves predicting future electricity demand using historical consumption data. Accurate forecasts are essential for maintaining grid stability and ensuring that generation matches demand.
#### Real-World Impact:
- Grid reliability: Prevents blackouts by ensuring enough electricity is generated during peak periods.
- Cost savings: Allows operators to schedule generation more efficiently and avoid costly reserve usage.
- Renewable integration: Helps balance intermittent sources like solar and wind with predicted demand.

## ‚öôÔ∏èTools and Libraries 
- Jupyter 
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn

## To do: 
### Import Data 
- find and save the data set
- load data set using pandas 
- display first 5 roiws 
- check for any missing values 
- learn and understand the meaning of columns 

### Clean Data of Duplicates etc. 
- Handle missing or invalid values (dreop or fill them in)
- convert date and time columns into simple datetime format
- select feaqtures to use for prediction (time, voltgae, previopus power used)
 
### Split data into training/training sets

### creater a model 
- plot graphs using matplotlib to understand trends (power/time, voltage/time)
- use Scitkit-learn to create a linear regression model
- predict power usage on test data 
- evaluate the models performance 

### train the model 
### make predictions
