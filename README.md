# Smart-Energy-Usage-Predictor
Predicts household electricity usage based on historical data using Python and Machine Learning 

## My motivation
When I first decide to create this project, I wanted to start applying Python to things that would further build my knowledge and confidence in the language. I also wanted to showcase my ability to pick up and learn different technical skills when I am outside of my comfort zone. When completing this project, I have no knowledge of machine learning and basic knowledge from pythonl; just the curiosity to learn a new skill.
